As you know, being someone with a graphic design background and working in that profession it's important to consistantly refine your skills.  With limited experience in web design and programming I believe it's extremely important to add these skills to my primarily print based background.
While I'm taking this class to boost my abilities and values for my current job, I would also like to switch my focus and become a valuable asset as a detail oriented Front-end Developer in a growing local start-up. I've currently been designing layout for start-ups (both mobile and web platforms) and would rather bring my own designs to life then having to find a developer to illustrate my visions. 
The current company I'm a CoFounder in is Boastify.com and since launching our Beta last month I've seen a number of bugs and issues I would like to maintain/fix myself. It's extremely tough to work with developers from an off site location when you're in testing and developing future versions.
